    <h2> The Problem</h2>
    <p> Women are one of the greatest struggles that Tyler has in his life. He is good at almost everything except this. Girls have described being in the same room as him as "unnerving," "strange," or even "frightening." I have made a table below to illustrate this.</p>
    
  <table>
   <tr> 
     <th> Girls he's talked to</th>
    <th> Girls he's had any physical interaction with</th>
     <th> Ratio </th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td> 0 </td>
      <td> 0 </td>
    <td> undefined </td>
    </tr>
     
    </table>
    
    <p> As you can see, Tyler struggles so much to even speak to girls, that my calculations have shown that some statistics I would normally give to describe his situation are actually undefined. That is another level of problematic.</p>
    
    <h2>
      The Solution </h2>
    <p> Top scientists worldwide have been studying his efforsts for years with no ideas on how to proceed. His looks are flawless. His game is so good you'd think Davy Crockett shot it on the Oregon Trail. The female aversion to him is truly inexplicable.</p>
